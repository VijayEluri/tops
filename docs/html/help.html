<h2>What is this all about?</h2>
<p>PDB files have been 'squashed' to make a 'cartoon' structure, which is a psuedo-2D 
representation. This has been further simplified to produce the 'linear' form - which preserves
hydrogen bonds and chiralities, but not distances.</p>

<p>This linear format can conveniently be written as a string; although it is the programmer's convenience, rather than the users!
