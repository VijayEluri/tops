							There are a variety of web 'services' (if that is the right term) available from the two web sites. The main <a href="http://www.tops.leeds.ac.uk" target="_top">Leeds</a> site provides users with the means to look up the cartoons for particular proteins, and to submit PDB files for processing into a cartoon. There are also links to some of the services on the <a href="http://balabio.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tops" target="_top">Glasgow</a> site, such as matching and comparison.
						</p><p>
							The services at Glasgow are backed by the same basic engine components described in <a href="ch02.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Computational Engine">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>. However, there are a few different ways to supply the data as input to the backend. Matching and comparison can be done using either a PDB file (which is converted to a TOPS string) or by providing the string itself. There is also an interface to the matching engine that uses a library of predefined patterns (Rosmann Folds, TIM barrels, and so forth). These are stored in a database table, and can be added to or removed without affecting the system.

							The servlets that connect the HTML forms of the interface to the basic engine components of the backend do a variety of roles. There is the conversion of PDB files to dssp files, TOPS files, and finally strings - carried out by the <tt>PipelineServlet</tt> and some accessory classes. There are database queries to make to get the data to compute over, done in those servlets that also call the engine components.
						</p><p>
							Many of these servlets output logging data, for debugging purposes and for simply tracking usage of each service. Since many services go through the central <tt>PipelineServlet</tt>, it is convenient to record here which servlet the data is being passed on to; in fact, one of the parameters passed by some forms and servlets is a <tt>targetService</tt> string that is used to determine where the data is sent.

							There are two forms of graphical results used on the web site : cartoons and diagrams. These two types of display are discussed in <a href="ch05.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Visualization">Chapter&nbsp;5</a> in more detail, but there are some differences for the web display. The cartoon drawing capabilities of the <tt>CartoonServlet</tt> allow production of the output as any of : GIF image, Portable Document Format (PDF), PostScript (PS), or Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Much of the code for this was from David Westhead's editor application for modifying existing cartoons.
						</p><p>
							There is also the beginnings of an applet that also uses some of the editor components with the intention that it could become the front end to submitting user-defined structures instead of laboriously typing out a TOPS string. To do this correctly, however, it requires the ability to add hydrogen bonding and chiralities to the linked list of SSEs and to then export this data as a string.
						</p><p>
							Although it is not much used, an applet is available for display of TOPS strings as diagrams - that is, as linear graphs. It uses parameters in the applet tag to get the data; a <tt>head</tt> parameter gives the name of the structure, a <tt>body</tt> parameter gives the vertex string, and a <tt>tail</tt> parameter gives the edge string. This code has now been transplanted into a servlet, which takes the same parameters, but returns a GIF image.
