Changes from the original (Martin's code) to the new version.

Features Removed:
- Constraints dialog : an advanced feature that could be in the application.
- Colors dialog : a non-feature; TOPS cartoons look the way they look. Use photoshop.
- Single/Multiple selection radiobuttons. Multiple selection is better using shift-click.
- Switching the visibility of toolbars and figure types. Not necessary.

Alterations:
- Terminii are 'first-class' Symbols; they have their own position & are moveable.
- No arrows on connectors. This is non-standard, and unnecessary because...
- ...connectors to edge/center works right now.
- Selection boxes on connectors are larger (and better) and visible on mouseover.
- Helices are back to being circles.
- No jump on first dragging.
- The symbol library is shared with the DiagramEditor.
- Delete is now click-delete, not 'delete selected'. The latter is fine, but redundant.
- Selection is multiple, not sure whether to use shift-click or not.
- Chirals are dashed lines, not arcs. Could change.

Features as normal:
- Selecting, dragging, multiple dragging all work fine.
- Select all menu item works. (Accelerator keys don't on the mac, though :(
- Undo works again. Really, really. Now that clone is implemented properly...
- Align (with ONE 'l') works for horizontal and vertical.
- Adding bonds works, but could be better.
- Exporting works to jpg.
- Deleting symbols works.

Features that don't yet work:
- Flip X axis/Y axis never did what it was meant to.
- Zoom In/Zoom Out.
- Printing. May not be needed.
- Help system has been removed, but needs to be added back.
- Templates need to be back!
- Symbol number checkmenuitem. This should be added back, as it is a good idea.
- Custom cursors are disabled, but not removed. Add back when the images are better.

New Features:
- Center menu item. Works.
- Export to png menu item. Works.
- Highlight symbols on mouseover.
