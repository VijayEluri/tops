Validation:
- Need to be able to set cartoons to accept or reject certain bond types.
- The main (only?) use for this is to occasianally allow EE 1:2A oddities.
- Also possible that cartoons could validate in 3D? (archie's code)
- Better to have a separate TopologyObject?

Zoom:
- Recreate...
- Centering with zoom.

Dragging:
- With multiple selections, simply dragging relative to total bounds.

Selections:
- Selection by elastic box?

Centering:
- When adding a new figure, could center.

Flipping:
- Port the ReflectXY code from TopsDrawCanvas?
- Same with the Rotate methods.

General:
- Fix the load/save.
- Centering button. Four arrows pointing to the center?

Ideas:
- Alignment by Strategy pattern (just like awt.Layout objects, really)
- Bigger icons.
- Multiple cartoons on one canvas? Cartoon bounding box selection halos!
- Add more stuff from TopsDrawCanvas.
- Multi-point connections.
